Changes in Version 0.9-01
  o spml as common wrapper for all ML based estimators
  o fixed syntax in spgm and sphtest for consistency with spml (essentially: 'model=c("within", "random", "pooling")' argument as in 'plm')
  o reordered arguments in estimators according to specification logic: formula, data, model type, effects, spatial error and lag
  o changed names for error and lag components in 'spreml' according to 'spgm' nomenclature: spatial lag is lambda, error is rho. RE variance ratio stays phi.

Changes in Version 0.8-03
  o fixed the joint bsktest, pvalue comes now from pchibar{ibdreg}; added dependency on 'ibdreg' but nothing in NAMESPACE because 'ibdreg' doesn't have one

Changes in Version 0.8-02
  o fixed the bsktest, now only formula methods and correct pvals
	
Changes in Version 0.8-01
  o added the spatial hausman test
  o deleted bsjk test and corrected the bsk tests
  o added spgm: general function that deals with all the GM estimators
  o added the methodologies in Mutl and Pfaffermeyer (2011) and Piras (2011) 
  for the estimation of the GM models sperrorgm and spsarargm
  o includes the following estimators: ivplm.w2sls, ivplm.b2sls, ivplm.ec2sls, ivplm.g2sls
  along with ivsplm that is the wrapper to use them. 
  
Changes in Version 0.2-04
  o dependency changed from kinship to bdsmatrix; removed require(kinship) from all functions

Changes in Version 0.2-02
  o spfeml: Added methods for Jacobian


Changes in Version 0.2-01


  o spregm: modified to allow for additional endogenous variables and lag of the dependent variable
  o Added spfegm 
  o Added spseml
  o spsegm: improved substantially and now reads a list of formulas.
