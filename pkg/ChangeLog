Changes in Version 1.0-00
  o fixed prblem with spgm due to residuals of plm models now being pseries
  o added /inst/CITATION, added reference to JSS paper in docs

Changes in Version 0.9-05
  o the call reported by spml is now, correctly, the user-level one instead of spreml' or spfeml's one
  o example(spml) now produces a fixed effects and a random effects example
  o the 'usaww' contiguity matrix for USA continental states has been fixed (Florida's neighbours were wrong) and documentation in usaww.Rd has been improved
  o fixed the problem in fixed effects sarar model ML 
Changes in Version 0.9-04
  o added visible vcov.splm method for interoperability with lmtest, car

Changes in Version 0.9-03
  o reinroduced bsjktest, excluding C.3; syntax harmonized with bsktest
  o removed spreml, spfeml from namespace and documentation
  o fixed documentation
  o fixed parameter names in (hidden) spreml estimators: sr, semsr, srre and semsrre +/- sar (now phi=RE variance ratio, psi=AR, rho=SEM, lambda=SAR)
  o fixed parameter names in functions calling spreml (pbsjkSDtest)


Changes in Version 0.9-02
  o standardized versions of marginal bsktest reintroduced
  o all examples now on full 'Produc' dataset

Changes in Version 0.9-01
  o spml as common wrapper for all ML based estimators
  o fixed syntax in spgm and sphtest for consistency with spml (essentially: 'model=c("within", "random", "pooling")' argument as in 'plm')
  o reordered arguments in estimators according to specification logic: formula, data, model type, effects, spatial error and lag
  o changed names for error and lag components in 'spreml' according to 'spgm' nomenclature: spatial lag is lambda, error is rho. RE variance ratio stays phi.

Changes in Version 0.8-03
  o fixed the joint bsktest, pvalue comes now from pchibar{ibdreg}; added dependency on 'ibdreg' but nothing in NAMESPACE because 'ibdreg' doesn't have one

Changes in Version 0.8-02
  o fixed the bsktest, now only formula methods and correct pvals
	
Changes in Version 0.8-01
  o added the spatial hausman test
  o deleted bsjk test and corrected the bsk tests
  o added spgm: general function that deals with all the GM estimators
  o added the methodologies in Mutl and Pfaffermeyer (2011) and Piras (2011) 
  for the estimation of the GM models sperrorgm and spsarargm
  o includes the following estimators: ivplm.w2sls, ivplm.b2sls, ivplm.ec2sls, ivplm.g2sls
  along with ivsplm that is the wrapper to use them. 
  
Changes in Version 0.2-04
  o dependency changed from kinship to bdsmatrix; removed require(kinship) from all functions

Changes in Version 0.2-02
  o spfeml: Added methods for Jacobian


Changes in Version 0.2-01


  o spregm: modified to allow for additional endogenous variables and lag of the dependent variable
  o Added spfegm 
  o Added spseml
  o spsegm: improved substantially and now reads a list of formulas.
